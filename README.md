## Visual Setup Guide

The setup wizard (`npm run setup`) handles OAuth authentication automatically. Here's where to find your credentials in the eBay Developer Portal:

### Finding Your Credentials

**Step 1:** Navigate to [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys) and copy your **App ID (Client ID)** and **Cert ID (Client Secret)**:

![Step 1 - Copy credentials from eBay Developer Portal](public/screenshot-guides/STEP%20-%201%20-%20COPY%20CLIENT%20ID%20AND%20CLIENT%20SECRET%20TO%20ENV%20FILE.png)

**Step 2:** In your app's **User Tokens** settings, copy the **RuName** (eBay Redirect URL):

![Step 2 - Copy RuName from eBay Sign-in Settings](public/screenshot-guides/STEP%20-%202%20-%20COPY%20REDIRECT%20URL.png)

### Running the Setup Wizard

Run `npm run setup` and enter your credentials when prompted. The wizard will:

1. Open your browser for OAuth login automatically
2. Guide you through the eBay sign-in process

![Step 3 - Sign in to eBay during OAuth flow](public/screenshot-guides/STEP%203%20-%20RUN%20COMMAND%20NPM%20RUN%20SETUP%20AND%20PREFORM%20OAUTH%20LOGIN.png)

3. Ask you to paste the authorization code from the callback URL

![Step 4 - Paste authorization code into setup wizard](public/screenshot-guides/STEP%20-%204%20-%20PASTE%20INTO%20THE%20SETUP%20WIZARD.png)

4. Exchange the code for tokens and save them automatically
5. Configure your MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.)

**Success!** You now have user token authentication with 10k-50k requests/day instead of the default 1k/day.

---

### 4. Use

Restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.) and start using eBay tools through your AI assistant.

## Configuration

> 📖 **For a comprehensive configuration guide with detailed explanations of all environment variables, OAuth flow steps, and troubleshooting, see [Configuration Documentation](docs/auth/CONFIGURATION.md).**

### Environment Variables

The setup wizard (`npm run setup`) automatically creates and configures your `.env` file. For reference, these are the environment variables used:

```bash
EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or "production"
EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=your_runame
EBAY_MARKETPLACE_ID=EBAY_US  # Default marketplace (overridable by many tools)
EBAY_CONTENT_LANGUAGE=en-US  # Default request content language (global)
EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token  # For higher rate limits
```

### OAuth Authentication

**Client Credentials (Default):** 1,000 requests/day - works automatically with just Client ID and Secret.

**User Tokens (Recommended):** 10,000-50,000 requests/day - the setup wizard handles the OAuth flow automatically. Tokens refresh automatically.

For detailed OAuth setup and comprehensive configuration guide, see the [Configuration Documentation](docs/auth/CONFIGURATION.md).

### Rate Limiting

Understanding eBay API rate limits is crucial for production use:

**Client Credentials (Default):**

- **Daily Limit:** 1,000 requests per day
- **Best For:** Development, testing, low-volume operations
- **Setup:** Automatic with just Client ID and Secret

**User Token (Recommended):**

- **Daily Limit:** 10,000-50,000 requests per day (varies by account type)
- **Best For:** Production, high-volume operations
- **Setup:** Requires OAuth flow (use `ebay_get_oauth_url` tool)

**Rate Limit Tiers by Account Type:**

- Individual Developer: 10,000 requests/day
- Commercial Developer: 25,000 requests/day
- Enterprise: 50,000+ requests/day (custom limits)

**Rate Limit Best Practices:**

1. Use user tokens for production workloads
2. Implement exponential backoff on rate limit errors
3. Cache responses when possible
4. Monitor your usage in the eBay Developer Portal
5. Batch operations when the API supports it
6. Consider upgrading your developer account tier for higher limits

**Handling Rate Limits:**

When you hit a rate limit, the API returns a 429 status code. The server will:

- Automatically retry with exponential backoff
- Inform you of rate limit errors
- Suggest upgrading to user token authentication

**Check Current Usage:**

Monitor your API usage in the [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com/my/api_usage).

## Usage Examples

Here are some common tasks you can accomplish with the eBay MCP server:

### Setting Up OAuth for Higher Rate Limits

**User:** "Can you help me set up OAuth authentication for my eBay account?"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_get_oauth_url` tool to generate an authorization URL. You visit the URL, grant permissions, and the assistant helps you configure the refresh token in your `.env` file.

**Result:** Access to 10,000-50,000 API requests per day instead of 1,000.

### Managing Inventory

**User:** "Show me all my active listings on eBay"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_get_inventory_items` to retrieve all inventory items.

**Result:** Displays a formatted list of all your products with SKUs, quantities, and status.

### Processing Orders

**User:** "Get all unfulfilled orders from the last 7 days"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_get_orders` with date filters and fulfillment status parameters.

**Result:** Returns a list of pending orders ready for shipment processing.

### Creating Marketing Campaigns

**User:** "Create a promoted listing campaign for my electronics category"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_create_campaign` and related marketing tools to set up ad campaigns.

**Result:** New campaign created with specified budget and target items.

### Bulk Operations

**User:** "Update prices for all items in category 'Vintage Watches' with a 10% discount"

**Assistant:** Combines `ebay_get_inventory_items`, filters by category, and uses `ebay_update_offer` to apply bulk pricing changes.

**Result:** All matching items updated with new pricing.
